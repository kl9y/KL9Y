         <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
         <p class="aboutText">If you're seeing this thank you for visiting kl9y.com! That also means you wanna know about us. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? One day some kid named Myth also known as Nick was looking for a teammate to play a tournament with back in 2022 and low and behold found some guy named KL9Y. They hit it off and almost won a prize. 
            They continued to talk from time to time checking up on eachother seeing as how they were living similar 
            lives. Until one day everything changed. Myth reached out to play some games and talk, when they remembered 
            why they become friends in the first place. These guys became so tight that there wasn't one day going by 
            that they weren't talking and gaming. That wasn't just it. Myth had a dream, a dream of starting a brand 
            that would change everything for the both of them. At first it was a simple idea sprouted from that dream 
            but that all changed when Klay bought the domain of kl9y.com. Myth thought what a better way of making 
            this dream come true than with his best friend who had experience in software and coding, just like him 
            and who had a similar vision. They brainstormed for months thinking about the brand, it's logo, what it 
            would represent. Finally, it hit them. Clothes that were affordable and comfortable with appealing designs. 
            Something you don't see often anymore. They worked on designs going through hundreds and they finally 
            settled. Something was wrong though. Their supplier fell through but that didn't stop them. After 
            countless days of looking for a new supplier, they found someone better than the last who could truly 
            achieve their dream. And at last kl9y.com would be born. They continued to work and grind progressing 
            this website made from scratch until you see what is today. After hard work and ups and downs, 
            kl9y.com is here. This isn't just a brand however. KL9Y is a lifestyle. A lifestyle of perseverance, achieving 
            greatness, and knowing that you have limitless potential.
